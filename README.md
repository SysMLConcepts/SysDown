SysDown
=======

### Inspiration (necessity is the mother of invention) ###

 * SysML tools too complicated (especially for n00bs, or people who don't intend to major in the topic)
 * Data representation is not "free" and not easily editable/usable without heavyweight tools
  - SysML data, as it stands, cannot be hand-edited on a far-away island with nothing more than vim
 * todo.txt amazing example of how you can build useful tools around very simple data representation and simple set of rules 
 
### Goals ###

 * SysML concepts represented in a text-based format (Markdown)
 * Inspired by todo.txt concept
 * Ubiquitous access to creation, editing, visualizing, and otherwise working with SysmL diagrams and concepts
  - Access from mobile devices (javascript/html only required)
  - Access from any text editor (vim, nano, Emacs, Notepad++, ...)
  - Should be able to work from anywhere...
