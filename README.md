SysDown
=======

### Inspiration (necessity is the mother of invention) ###

 * SysML tools too complicated (especially for n00bs, or people who don't intend to major in the topic)
 * Data representation is not "free" and not easily editable/usable without heavyweight tools
  - SysML data, as it stands, cannot be hand-edited on a far-away island with nothing more than vim
 * [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) amazing example of how you can build useful tools around very simple data representation and simple set of rules 
 
### Goals ###

 * SysML concepts represented in a text-based format (Markdown)
 * Inspired by todo.txt concept
 * Ubiquitous access to creation, editing, visualizing, and otherwise working with SysmL diagrams and concepts
  - Access from mobile devices (javascript/html only required)
    - one possible form similar to [tiddlywiki](Http://tiddlywiki.com), with a single file
      - sysml editor (text and graphics)
        - codemirror and epicdeditor
        - asciiflow, something like ditaa
      - presentation editor a la [rvl.io](http://rvl.io)
      - instance editor a la handsontable
  - Access from any text editor (vim, nano, Emacs, Notepad++, ...)
  - Should be able to work from anywhere...
  - expose the "good parts" of downstream sysml
    - par, stm and act execution
